Group: Tarangkumar, Adrian, Saiful, Shrenik, Eric

Objective: Our objective for this project was to find the relationship between different types of stocks and fed interest rates, and how we can use that data
to navigate volatile interest rate market environments such as a recession

our 3 questions: 
# 1. What is the dynamic between dividend, growth and bluechip stocks?
# 2. What is the relationship between interest rate and growth, dividend and blue chip stocks? 
# 3. How can we find out the best time to invest in different type of stocks like when to enter and exit?

definitions of stock types
Growth stock: A company stock that increases in capital value rather than yielding an income from it (Google, Amazon)
Dividend stock: A stock that payments are made by companies to their shareholders based on the number of shares they own (Enbridge, Coca cola)
Blue chip stock: A blue chip is stock in a stock corporation with a national reputation for quality, reliability, and the ability to operate profitably in good and bad times
(TD, RBC)

Question 1 conclusion: All three stock types face different levels of volatility. Growth stocks face the most volatility then followed by Blue chip and Dividend stocks. 

## Question 2. Relationship between interest rate and stock types

Question 2 conclusion: As we can see in this graph, the growth stock (Google) responded with a lot of volatility to any percentage change in interest rate. During times with uncertain interest rate adjustments it is smart to look to less volatile stocks such as Dividend or a Blue chip stock depending on your risk apetite. 

## Question 3. How can we find the best time to invest 
There will never be a "best time to invest" but according to our data, depending on your risk apetite, it is beneficial to store some value in Dividend or Blue chip stocks during a time of interest rate uncertainty to protect yourself from high levels of volatility.
